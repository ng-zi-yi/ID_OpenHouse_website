                    <h4>Design</h4>
                    <p>More than ever, design is shaping the future. Designers play a key role in developing solutions for the 
                        many challenges we face today. From architecture to products, and experiences to processes, the designer 
                        helps create a better world. In the Diploma in Design (DES) - the only poly diploma with specialisations 
                        in Architecture and Product Innovation - you will be trained for creative careers in diverse sectors. 
                        In fact, design has become so fundamental that many non-design companies are hiring design-trained 
                        professionals!</p>
